# Component Library Lab – React + TypeScript

This project is a small internal component library built with React and TypeScript.  
It includes three reusable UI components:

- `AlertBox` – shows alert messages in different visual styles.
- `UserProfileCard` – displays user information with optional sections.
- `ProductDisplay` – displays product information with configurable options.

These components are designed to be strongly typed, flexible, and easy to reuse across multiple applications.
